	- Express (npm i express)
	- nodemon (npm i nodemon) - this is actually not compulsory but neccessay.
	- dotenv (npm i dotenv) - you will write your database string there.



### Continued development

- using it to call data from the server to the client side in a real world programming
- creating dashboard, sending, getting data request from the front end
